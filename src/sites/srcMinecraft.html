Minecraft will not work sadly because the file is WAYY too big. If you want it,
just go to the blue shark form requests at the bottom at the page and send me your gmail
so i can send it to you (I will send it to you on my alt account)

The file will be sent in html format, download it and run it by double clicking it in files.
